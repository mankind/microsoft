# Microsoft

This gem was extracted out of an app I am currently working on.
The app needed to send and receive email on behalf of our customers.
So we integrated with Gmail and Microsoft outlook.

There are plans to extract the part that integrates with Microsoft Calendar in the future.

## Installation

In your gemfile, you need to point at this repo on Github but it will be released to rubygems when ready.

gem 'microsoft', github: "mankind/microsoft"


```ruby
gem 'microsoft'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install microsoft

## Usage

This will be added this shortly

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
